# Summary of MQTT Connection Fix

## Problem
The agent was hanging when trying to connect to MQTT broker on `localhost:5883`. The issue had multiple causes:

### Root Causes

1. **Missing Configuration**: The eclipse-mosquitto Docker image (v2.0.20+) defaults to "local only mode" when no explicit listener configuration is provided, refusing external connections.

2. **No Connection Timeout**: The MQTT client in `mqtt-backend.ts` didn't have a connection timeout, causing the application to hang indefinitely.

3. **Missing MQTT Methods**: The `MqttLogBackend` class was missing `publish()`, `subscribe()`, and `unsubscribe()` methods that the Shadow feature was trying to use.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Created Mosquitto Configuration (`api/mosquitto.conf`)
```conf
# Main MQTT listener - bind to all interfaces
listener 1883 0.0.0.0
allow_anonymous true
allow_zero_length_clientid true

# WebSocket listener
listener 9001 0.0.0.0
protocol websockets
allow_anonymous true

# Logging
log_dest stdout
log_type all
```

**Key**: Binding to `0.0.0.0` allows connections from outside the container.

### 2. Updated Docker Compose (`api/docker-compose.cloud.yml`)
Added volume mount:
```yaml
mosquitto:
    volumes:
      - ./mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
```

### 3. Added Connection Timeout (`agent/src/logging/mqtt-backend.ts`)
- Added 10-second connection timeout
- Added `connectTimeout` option to mqtt.connect()
- Proper cleanup on timeout

### 4. Added MQTT Direct Methods (`agent/src/logging/mqtt-backend.ts`)
Added methods for Shadow feature:
- `publish(topic, payload, qos)` - Direct MQTT publishing
- `subscribe(topic, qos, handler)` - Topic subscription with handler
- `unsubscribe(topic)` - Unsubscribe from topics
- `topicMatches()` - MQTT wildcard topic matching (+, #)

## Testing

### Test MQTT Connection
```powershell
docker run --rm eclipse-mosquitto mosquitto_pub -h host.docker.internal -p 5883 -t test/topic -m "test" -d
```

### Test Agent Connection
Run agent with MQTT enabled:
```powershell
$env:MQTT_BROKER='mqtt://localhost:5883'
$env:ENABLE_SHADOW='true'
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- The timeout prevents the agent from hanging if MQTT is unavailable
- MQTT is optional - if connection fails, the agent continues without it
- Shadow feature gracefully handles missing MQTT backend
- Configuration is for **development only** (anonymous access enabled)

## Production Recommendations

For production deployment:
1. Enable authentication (`allow_anonymous false`)
2. Use `mosquitto_passwd` to create password file
3. Configure TLS/SSL encryption
4. Set up proper ACLs for topic access control
5. Use longer connection timeouts (30-60s) for unreliable networks
