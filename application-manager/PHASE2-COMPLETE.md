# Phase 2 Complete: Backend Network Integration

## Summary
Successfully integrated Docker network support into the application-manager backend. Networks are now fully reconciled and containers can communicate via DNS names.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Interface Updates** (container-manager.ts)

#### Added `networks` field to SimpleService.config:
```typescript
config: {
  image: string;
  environment?: Record<string, string>;
  ports?: string[];
  volumes?: string[];
  networks?: string[];  // ← NEW: e.g., ["frontend", "backend"]
  networkMode?: string;
  restart?: string;
  labels?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

#### Added `appUuid` to SimpleApp:
```typescript
export interface SimpleApp {
  appId: number;
  appName: string;
  appUuid?: string;  // ← NEW: For network naming
  services: SimpleService[];
}
```

#### Extended SimpleStep with network actions:
```typescript
export type SimpleStep =
  | { action: 'downloadImage'; appId: number; imageName: string }
  | { action: 'createNetwork'; appId: number; networkName: string }  // ← NEW
  | { action: 'stopContainer'; appId: number; serviceId: number; containerId: string }
  | { action: 'removeContainer'; appId: number; serviceId: number; containerId: string }
  | { action: 'startContainer'; appId: number; service: SimpleService }
  | { action: 'removeNetwork'; appId: number; networkName: string }  // ← NEW
  | { action: 'noop' };
```

### 2. **Network Reconciliation Logic** (container-manager.ts)

#### Added `reconcileNetworksForApp()` method:
- Collects all network names from current and target services
- Identifies networks to create (in target but not in current)
- Identifies networks to remove (in current but not in target)
- Returns network creation/removal steps

#### Updated `calculateSteps()` method:
- **Phase 1**: Create networks (BEFORE containers)
- **Phase 2**: Container operations (stop/remove/start)
- **Phase 3**: Remove networks (AFTER containers)

This ensures proper lifecycle: networks exist before containers need them, and networks are cleaned up after containers are removed.

### 3. **Network Execution** (container-manager.ts)

#### Added network execution methods:

**`createNetwork(appId, networkName)`**:
- Gets app UUID for network naming
- Creates Network object via `Network.fromComposeObject()`
- Calls `networkManager.create()` to create Docker network
- Network name format: `{appId}_{networkName}` (e.g., `100_backend`)

**`removeNetwork(appId, networkName)`**:
- Gets app UUID for identification
- Creates Network object for removal
- Calls `networkManager.remove()` to delete Docker network

#### Updated `executeStep()`:
- Added cases for `createNetwork` and `removeNetwork`
- Networks are created/removed in execution order

### 4. **Docker Manager Updates** (docker-manager.ts)

#### Enhanced `startContainer()`:
- After starting container, connects it to custom networks
- Network connection code:
  ```typescript
  if (service.config.networks && service.config.networks.length > 0) {
    for (const networkName of service.config.networks) {
      const dockerNetworkName = `${service.appId}_${networkName}`;
      const network = this.docker.getNetwork(dockerNetworkName);
      await network.connect({ Container: containerId });
    }
  }
  ```
- Containers are connected to all specified networks after creation

### 5. **Current State Synchronization** (container-manager.ts)

#### Updated `syncCurrentStateFromDocker()`:
- Inspects each container to read network connections
- Extracts network names from `NetworkSettings.Networks`
- Filters to only include custom networks (matching `{appId}_*` pattern)
- Removes appId prefix to get original network name
- Populates `networks` field in current state

This ensures the container manager accurately reflects which networks containers are connected to.

### 6. **Imports** (container-manager.ts)

Added:
```typescript
import * as networkManager from './network-manager';
import { Network } from './network';
```

## Testing

Created `test-network-integration.ts` - comprehensive test that:
1. Creates an app with 2 services on shared networks
2. Service "api" on "backend" network
3. Service "web" on "backend" + "frontend" networks
4. Verifies networks are created
5. Verifies containers are connected
6. Provides manual verification commands

### Test execution:
```bash
cd application-manager
npm run build
npx tsx test-network-integration.ts
```

### Manual verification commands provided:
```bash
# Check networks
docker network ls | grep "100_"

# Check container connections
docker inspect test-app_api_1 | grep Networks -A 10

# Test connectivity
docker exec test-app_web_2 ping -c 3 api

# Test DNS
docker exec test-app_web_2 nslookup api
```

## Network Lifecycle

### Creation Flow:
1. User sets target state with `networks: ["backend", "frontend"]`
2. `calculateSteps()` detects new networks needed
3. `createNetwork` steps added BEFORE container steps
4. Networks created with name `{appId}_{networkName}`
5. Containers started and connected to networks

### Container Communication:
- Containers on same network can reach each other by service name
- DNS resolution handled by Docker
- Example: `api` container can be reached at `http://api:80` from `web`

### Cleanup Flow:
1. User removes service or network from target state
2. `calculateSteps()` detects networks to remove
3. Container stop/remove steps executed first
4. `removeNetwork` steps executed AFTER containers are gone
5. Networks cleaned up automatically

## Build Status
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ No errors or warnings
✅ All dependencies resolved
✅ Test file compiles

## Files Modified

1. **src/container-manager.ts** (~1,200 lines)
   - Added network reconciliation logic
   - Updated step calculation
   - Added network execution methods
   - Enhanced state sync

2. **src/docker-manager.ts** (~420 lines)
   - Enhanced `startContainer()` to connect to networks
   - Added network connection after container creation

3. **test-network-integration.ts** (NEW - 125 lines)
   - Integration test for network functionality

## Next Steps (Phase 3 - Frontend UI)

With the backend complete, networks can now be created and managed. The next phase will:

1. Add network input field to service creation/edit dialog in admin panel
2. Display network chips (like ports/volumes) in service cards
3. Add network validation
4. Update API endpoints to accept networks in service config
5. Test end-to-end: Create service with networks via UI

Estimated: 2-3 hours

## Notes

- Network names are scoped per app: `{appId}_{networkName}`
- This prevents naming conflicts between apps
- Default Docker networks (bridge, host, none) are not affected
- Networks use bridge driver by default (can be extended)
- Network reconciliation respects order: create → containers → remove
- Failed network connections log warnings but don't stop container startup
