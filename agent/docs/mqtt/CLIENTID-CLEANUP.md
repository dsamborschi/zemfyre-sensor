# MQTT Client ID Cleanup

## Issue

The code was passing `clientId` options to `MqttShadowAdapter` and `MqttLogBackend` even though these were being **ignored** by the centralized `MqttManager`.

## Root Cause

When using the singleton pattern with `MqttManager.getInstance()`:

1. **First call** to `mqttManager.connect()` establishes connection with provided options
2. **Subsequent calls** return immediately (no-op) if already connected
3. Any `clientId`, `username`, `password` passed in subsequent calls are **silently ignored**

## Code Flow (Before Fix)

```typescript
// supervisor.ts

// Step 1: Initialize MQTT Manager (line 186)
await this.initializeMqttManager();
  ‚Üí mqttManager.connect(broker, { clientId: 'device_abc123', ... })
  ‚Üí ‚úÖ Connection established with clientId: 'device_abc123'

// Step 2: Initialize Logging (line 231)
await this.initializeLogging();
  ‚Üí new MqttLogBackend({ clientOptions: { clientId: 'device_abc123' } })
  ‚Üí mqttManager.connect(broker, { clientId: 'device_abc123' })
  ‚Üí ‚è≠Ô∏è Already connected, options IGNORED

// Step 3: Initialize Shadow (line 600)
await this.initializeShadowFeature();
  ‚Üí new MqttShadowAdapter(broker, { clientId: 'shadow-abc123' })
  ‚Üí mqttManager.connect(broker, { clientId: 'shadow-abc123' })
  ‚Üí ‚è≠Ô∏è Already connected, clientId 'shadow-abc123' IGNORED
```

## The Fix

**Removed unused `clientId` parameters** and added clear comments explaining that:
- MqttManager is already connected by `initializeMqttManager()`
- Connection options are ignored in subsequent `connect()` calls
- All features share the single client: `device_${deviceInfo.uuid}`

### Changes Made

**File**: `agent/src/supervisor.ts`

#### 1. MqttLogBackend (line ~272)

**Before**:
```typescript
const deviceInfo = this.deviceManager.getDeviceInfo();
const mqttBackend = new MqttLogBackend({
  brokerUrl: process.env.MQTT_BROKER,
  clientOptions: {
    clientId: `device_${deviceInfo.uuid}`,  // ‚ùå Ignored!
  },
  // ...
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Note: MqttLogBackend uses centralized MqttManager
// Connection is already established in initializeMqttManager()
const mqttBackend = new MqttLogBackend({
  brokerUrl: process.env.MQTT_BROKER,
  clientOptions: {
    // clientId is already set in initializeMqttManager() as device_${uuid}
    // No need to pass it again - these options are ignored
  },
  // ...
});
```

#### 2. MqttShadowAdapter (line ~638)

**Before**:
```typescript
mqttConnection = new MqttShadowAdapter(
  process.env.MQTT_BROKER,
  {
    clientId: `shadow-${deviceInfo.uuid}`,  // ‚ùå Ignored!
    username: process.env.MQTT_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.MQTT_PASSWORD,
  }
);
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Note: MqttShadowAdapter reuses the existing MQTT connection established in initializeMqttManager()
// The clientId, username, and password were already set there, so we don't need to pass them again
mqttConnection = new MqttShadowAdapter(
  process.env.MQTT_BROKER,
  {
    // Options are ignored since MqttManager is already connected
    // If this was called before initializeMqttManager(), these would be used
  }
);
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Clarity**: Code now accurately reflects what's happening  
‚úÖ **No Confusion**: Readers won't think multiple clients are created  
‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Clear comments explain the singleton pattern  
‚úÖ **No Functional Change**: Behavior is identical (options were already ignored)  

## Testing

Build verification:
```bash
cd agent
npm run build
# ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
```

Runtime verification:
```bash
cd agent
MQTT_DEBUG=true npm run dev
# Should see:
# üîå Initializing MQTT Manager...
# [MqttManager] Connecting to MQTT broker: mqtt://mosquitto:1883
# [MqttManager] ‚úÖ Connected to MQTT broker
#    Client ID: device_abc123-def456-...
#    All features will share this connection
```

## Lessons Learned

When implementing a singleton pattern for shared resources:

1. **Document the connection order** - Make it clear which initialization establishes the connection
2. **Remove redundant parameters** - Don't pass options that will be ignored
3. **Add explanatory comments** - Help future developers understand the pattern
4. **Make idempotency explicit** - Show that subsequent calls are no-ops
