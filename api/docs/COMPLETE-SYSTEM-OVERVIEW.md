## API Query Examples

### 1. Get All Buildings
```bash
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities?entity_type=building"
```

### 2. Get Full Maple Heights Hierarchy
```bash
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/relationships/1d9bc879-e45e-4a3f-8a09-4da4e0e59b8d/tree"
```

### 3. Search Across All Entities
```bash
# Find all cameras
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=camera"

# Find all HVAC equipment
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=hvac"

# Find all sensors
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=sensor"
```

### 4. Impact Analysis Queries
```bash
# What happens if Chiller fails?
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/graph/impact/a95ae3de-a982-4f72-8a0c-685a99fa67a3"
# Result: Lobby climate control affected

# What happens if IoT Gateway fails?
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/graph/impact/97175516-5da0-4468-af13-f9d1666ae4fd"
# Result: BME688 and Water sensors lose connectivity

# What happens if NVR fails?
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/graph/impact/0f8e5152-aac1-41d4-9144-e80517e80455"
# Result: No video recording from 3 cameras
```

### 5. Get Complete Graph Topology
```bash
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/graph/topology"
```
Returns JSON with:
- `nodes[]`: All entities with labels and types
- `edges[]`: All relationships with types
