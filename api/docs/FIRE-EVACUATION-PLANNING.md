## Evacuation Planning Use Cases

### 1. **Route Planning & Optimization**

**Query: Find all evacuation routes from Floor 3**

```bash
# Get Floor 3 entity
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=Floor%203"

# Find stairwells connected to Floor 3
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=stairwell"
```

**Result:** 3 stairwells (A, B, C) available
- Stairwell A ‚Üí Main entrance (96" exit, 120 people/min)
- Stairwell B ‚Üí Rear exit (72" exit, 80 people/min)
- Stairwell C ‚Üí Parking side exit

**Evacuation Time Calculation:**
- Floor 3 occupancy: 32 people (4 units √ó 8 people avg)
- Distributed across 3 stairwells: ~11 people per stairwell
- Descent time: 3 floors √ó 30 sec/floor = 90 seconds
- Exit time: 11 people √∑ 2 people/sec = 5 seconds
- **Total: ~2 minutes for Floor 3 evacuation**

### 2. **Critical Failure Impact Analysis**

**Scenario: Emergency Generator Fails**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/graph/impact/7ad3dc50-bb97-41e9-8fdc-8da122613fa8"
```

**Impacted Systems (Cascading Failure):**
1. ‚ùå Fire Pump (no backup power)
   - Sprinkler system pressure reduced
   - Upper floors (8-15) lose fire suppression
2. ‚ùå Fire Alarm Panel (loses power after battery ~24hrs)
   - Detection continues via battery
   - Central station communication at risk
3. ‚ùå Emergency Voice System (loses power after battery ~24hrs)
   - Evacuation announcements limited
   - Firefighter communications degraded
4. ‚ùå Stairwell Pressurization (fails)
   - Smoke can enter stairwells
   - Evacuation routes compromised

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Multiple life safety systems affected

**Mitigation**:
- Monthly generator tests required
- Automatic transfer switch (ATS) maintenance
- 48-hour fuel supply verified
- Mobile generator hookup available

### 3. **Capacity Planning**

**Query: Total building evacuation capacity**

```bash
# Get all evacuation routes
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=stairwell"
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=exit"
```

**Calculation:**

| Exit Route | Width | Capacity (people/min) | Notes |
|------------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| Stairwell A ‚Üí Main entrance | 60" + 96" | 120 | Primary route |
| Stairwell B ‚Üí Rear exit | 60" + 72" | 80 | Emergency route |
| Stairwell C ‚Üí Side exit | 60" + 48" | 60 | Parking access |
| **TOTAL** | | **260 people/min** | |

**Building Evacuation Time:**
- Total occupancy: 740 people
- Evacuation rate: 260 people/min
- **Full building evacuation: ~3 minutes (ideal conditions)**

**Reality factors:**
- Add 30 sec per floor for upper floors
- Mobility-impaired residents: 5-10 min
- Panic/crowding: +50% time
- **Realistic total: 8-12 minutes**

### 4. **Fire Spread Modeling**

**Scenario: Fire starts in Unit 302 (Floor 3)**

```bash
# Get Unit 302
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=Unit%20302"

# Find what contains it (floor)
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/relationships?target_entity_id=<unit_302_id>&relationship_type=CONTAINS"

# Find adjacent units
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/relationships/<floor_3_id>/children"
```

**Affected Areas (Time-based):**

**T+0 min**: Fire in Unit 302
- Sprinkler activates
- Smoke detector triggers
- Fire alarm sounds building-wide

**T+2 min**: Smoke spreads to hallway
- Hallway smoke detectors activate
- Floor 3 evacuation begins
- Stairwell doors must remain closed

**T+5 min**: If fire breaches unit
- Adjacent units at risk (301, 303, 304)
- Floor above (Floor 4) smoke migration risk
- Fire department notified automatically

**T+10 min**: Fire department arrival
- FDC connection used
- Standpipe access via stairwells
- Firefighter elevator to Floor 3

### 5. **Accessibility & Special Needs**

**Query: Identify residents needing assistance**

```bash
# This would query resident database (future feature)
# For now, track via entity metadata:

curl -X POST http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/<unit_id>/properties \
  -d '{
    "property_name": "accessibility_needs",
    "property_value": {
      "wheelchair": true,
      "hearing_impaired": false,
      "evacuation_time_minutes": 10,
      "requires_assistance": true,
      "rescue_zone": "Floor 3 Stairwell A landing"
    }
  }'
```

**Rescue Zones (Areas of Refuge):**
- Each floor has 3 stairwell landings
- 2-hour fire rating
- Emergency phone connection
- Marked for firefighter pickup
- Can shelter 4-6 people per landing

### 6. **Firefighter Operations Planning**

**Query: Find firefighter access points**

```bash
# Get standpipe locations
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=standpipe"

# Get FDC
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=department%20connection"

# Get stairwells with roof access
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=stairwell"
# Filter metadata: roof_access = true
```

**Firefighter Access Strategy:**

1. **Water Supply**:
   - FDC at main entrance
   - Connects to sprinkler + standpipe
   - 2 √ó 2.5" inlets
   - Boosts pressure to 125 PSI

2. **Vertical Access**:
   - Stairwell A (North) - Roof access ‚úì
   - Stairwell B (South) - Roof access ‚úì
   - Stairwell C (West) - No roof access
   - Firefighter elevator - Ground to 15

3. **Interior Attack**:
   - Standpipe connections every floor
   - 2.5" hose connections
   - Stairwell protection
   - Two-way communication system

4. **Aerial Operations** (if needed):
   - Penthouse rooftop access
   - Helicopter pad (emergency)
   - Roof hatch from Stairwells A & B

### 7. **Drill Planning & Simulation**

**Monthly Fire Drill Scenario:**

```bash
# Simulate Zone 3 alarm (Floors 1-7)

# 1. Check all smoke detectors in zone
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=smoke%20detector"
# Filter: zone = "Zone 3"

# 2. Verify evacuation routes available
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=stairwell"

# 3. Check assembly point capacity
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/entities/search?q=assembly"
# Verify: 224 people (Zone 3) < 500 capacity (Front Plaza)

# 4. Test emergency systems
curl "http://localhost:4002/api/v1/graph/impact/<generator_id>"
# Verify backup systems functional
```

**Drill Metrics to Track:**
- Evacuation completion time per floor
- Stairwell congestion points
- Assembly point arrival times
- Missing persons identification time
- All-clear confirmation time

**Target**: Full evacuation in < 5 minutes (realistic: 8-10 min)

## Advanced Evacuation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fire on Floor 10 (Upper Residential)

**Conditions:**
- Fire origin: Unit 1005
- Time: 2:00 AM (sleeping hours)
- Weather: Winter storm (assembly point issue)

**Evacuation Plan:**
1. **Immediate (T+0):**
   - Sprinkler activates in Unit 1005
   - Smoke detector triggers
   - Building-wide alarm sounds
   - Zone 4 alert (Floors 8-14)

2. **T+1 min:**
   - Floor 10 residents wake up
   - Evacuation begins via 3 stairwells
   - Emergency voice system announces floor

3. **T+2 min:**
   - Floors 9, 11 start evacuating (precautionary)
   - Firefighter elevator dispatched
   - Fire department en route (ETA 6 min)

4. **T+5 min:**
   - Floor 10 cleared
   - Floors 8-14 evacuation underway
   - Assembly point: Use Lobby due to weather (backup plan)

5. **T+8 min:**
   - Fire department arrives
   - FDC connection established
   - Standpipe attack from Floor 9 up

6. **T+12 min:**
   - All residents accounted for
   - Fire contained to Unit 1005
   - All-clear given for Floors 11-15

**Lessons:**
- Weather backup assembly point needed (lobby/parking)
- Upper floor evacuation takes longer
- Stairwell congestion at Floors 8-9
- Emergency voice system critical for floor-specific instructions

### Scenario 2: Parking Level Fire (Vehicle)

**Conditions:**
- Electric vehicle fire (thermal runaway)
- Location: Parking P1
- High smoke production, toxic fumes

**Evacuation Plan:**
1. **Detection (T+0):**
   - Parking smoke detector activates
   - Zone 2 alarm
   - Parking ventilation fans activate

2. **Evacuation (T+1 min):**
   - People in parking use Stairwell C (direct parking access)
   - Ground floor notified
   - Lobby evacuates via main entrance

3. **Fire Department (T+6 min):**
   - Approach from parking ramp
   - Ventilation critical (toxic fumes)
   - Sprinkler system activated

4. **Containment:**
   - EV fire requires hours to burn out
   - Parking level closed for 24-48 hours
   - Residents use street parking

**Lessons:**
- EV fires are unique challenge
- Ventilation system critical
- Parking-level evacuation is fastest (direct to outside)

### Scenario 3: Multi-Floor Fire (Worst Case)

**Conditions:**
- Fire spreads vertically through utility chase
- Affects Floors 3, 4, 5
- Stairwell B compromised (smoke infiltration)

**Evacuation Plan:**
1. **T+0:** Fire detected Floor 3
2. **T+2:** Spreads to Floor 4 (utility chase)
3. **T+3:** Stairwell B pressurization fails (smoke enters)
4. **T+4:** **CRITICAL DECISION:**
   - Redirect all evacuees to Stairwells A & C
   - Emergency voice system: "AVOID STAIRWELL B"
   - Floors 1-2 evacuate first (below fire)
   - Floors 6-15 shelter in place until clear

5. **T+10:** Fire department establishes command
   - Stairwell A used for evacuation (down)
   - Stairwell C used for firefighter access (up)
   - Standpipe operations from Floor 6

6. **T+20:** Fire contained
   - Floors 1-2 cleared
   - Floors 3-5 cleared via Stairwell A
   - Floors 6-15 evacuate in stages

**Lessons:**
- Redundancy is critical (3 stairwells)
- Emergency voice system essential for re-routing
- Shelter-in-place may be safer than evacuation (upper floors)
- Firefighter access separate from civilian evacuation
