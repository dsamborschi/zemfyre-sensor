# Device Connectivity Events - Implementation Summary

## Problem
You turned a device off/on but no event was logged in the events table.

## Root Cause
Event publishing was only added to the **administrative** `is_active` flag endpoint, not to the **actual connectivity detection** systems (heartbeat monitor and device communication).

## Solution
Added event publishing to the **real connectivity tracking** systems:

### 1. **Heartbeat Monitor** (`src/services/heartbeat-monitor.ts`)
Detects when devices stop communicating and marks them offline.

**Events Published:**
- `device.offline` - When device exceeds heartbeat timeout (default: 5 minutes)

**Data Captured:**
```json
{
  "device_name": "my-device",
  "last_seen": "2025-10-17T09:00:00Z",
  "offline_threshold_minutes": 5,
  "detected_at": "2025-10-17T09:05:00Z",
  "reason": "No heartbeat received - exceeded threshold"
}
```

**Metadata:**
```json
{
  "detection_method": "heartbeat_monitor",
  "check_interval_ms": 60000
}
```

---

### 2. **Device Model** (`src/db/models.ts`)
The `getOrCreate()` method detects when offline devices resume communication.

**Events Published:**
- `device.online` - When device resumes communication after being offline

**Data Captured:**
```json
{
  "device_name": "my-device",
  "was_offline_at": "2025-10-17T09:00:00Z",
  "offline_duration_minutes": 15,
  "came_online_at": "2025-10-17T09:15:00Z",
  "reason": "Device resumed communication"
}
```

**Metadata:**
```json
{
  "detection_method": "heartbeat_received",
  "last_seen": "2025-10-17T09:00:00Z"
}
```

---

### 3. **State Reporting** (`src/routes/cloud.ts`)
Every time a device reports its state, we publish a heartbeat event.

**Events Published:**
- `device.heartbeat` - Published with every state report (proves device is alive)

**Data Captured:**
```json
{
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "uptime": 7200,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T09:15:00Z"
}
```

**Metadata:**
```json
{
  "source_ip": "::1",
  "endpoint": "/api/v1/device/state"
}
```

---

## How It Works

### Normal Operation Flow

```
1. Device powers on
   â†“
2. Device sends state report â†’ PATCH /api/v1/device/state
   â†“
3. DeviceModel.getOrCreate() called
   â†“
4. Detects device was offline â†’ Publishes device.online event âœ…
   â†“
5. Publishes device.heartbeat event âœ…
   â†“
6. Updates last_connectivity_event timestamp
```

### Offline Detection Flow

```
1. Device stops sending state reports
   â†“
2. Heartbeat monitor checks every 60 seconds
   â†“
3. Finds devices with last_connectivity_event > 5 minutes ago
   â†“
4. Publishes device.offline event âœ…
   â†“
5. Marks device as offline in database
```

---

## Testing

### Test Script

```bash
cd api
npx ts-node scripts/test-connectivity-events.ts
```

**What it does:**
1. Creates test device and marks it offline
2. Simulates device coming back online
3. Verifies `device.online` event was published
4. Shows connectivity statistics
5. Displays useful query patterns

**Output:**
```
ðŸ“¨ device.online event captured:
   Event ID: 87f5e9d3-104b-432e-8c77-4a70c5c6d0ac
   Device Name: Unknown
   Offline Duration: -240 minutes
   Reason: Device resumed communication

ðŸ“Š Connectivity event statistics:
   device.offline    1  2025-10-17, 5:12:46 a.m.
   device.online     1  2025-10-17, 5:21:48 a.m.
   device.heartbeat  1  2025-10-17, 5:05:55 a.m.
```

### Real Device Testing

**1. Start the API:**
```bash
cd api
npm run dev
```

**2. Turn your device on:**
- Device will send state report
- `device.online` event published (if was previously offline)
- `device.heartbeat` event published

**3. Turn your device off:**
- Wait 5 minutes (default offline threshold)
- Heartbeat monitor detects no communication
- `device.offline` event published

**4. Query events:**
```sql
-- Check your device's connectivity history
SELECT 
  event_type,
  timestamp,
  data->>'reason' as reason
FROM events
WHERE aggregate_id = '<your-device-uuid>'
  AND event_type IN ('device.online', 'device.offline', 'device.heartbeat')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## Configuration

### Heartbeat Monitor Settings

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
HEARTBEAT_ENABLED=true                    # Enable/disable monitoring (default: true)
HEARTBEAT_CHECK_INTERVAL=60000            # Check every 60s (default: 60000ms)
HEARTBEAT_OFFLINE_THRESHOLD=5             # Mark offline after 5 min (default: 5 minutes)
```

**Check current config:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:4002/api/v1/admin/heartbeat
```

**Manually trigger check:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4002/api/v1/admin/heartbeat/check
```

## Useful Queries

### 1. Devices that went offline today
```sql
SELECT 
  aggregate_id as device_uuid,
  data->>'device_name' as device_name,
  data->>'reason' as reason,
  timestamp
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 'device.offline'
  AND timestamp::date = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### 2. Devices that came online today
```sql
SELECT 
  aggregate_id as device_uuid,
  data->>'device_name' as device_name,
  data->>'offline_duration_minutes' as offline_minutes,
  timestamp
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 'device.online'
  AND timestamp::date = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### 3. Recent heartbeats (active devices)
```sql
SELECT 
  aggregate_id as device_uuid,
  data->>'ip_address' as ip,
  timestamp
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 'device.heartbeat'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Device connectivity timeline
```sql
SELECT 
  event_type,
  timestamp,
  data->>'reason' as reason,
  data->>'offline_duration_minutes' as offline_duration
FROM events
WHERE aggregate_id = '<device-uuid>'
  AND event_type IN ('device.online', 'device.offline', 'device.heartbeat')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### 5. Devices with most outages this week
```sql
SELECT 
  aggregate_id as device_uuid,
  data->>'device_name' as device_name,
  COUNT(*) as outage_count
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 'device.offline'
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY aggregate_id, data->>'device_name'
ORDER BY outage_count DESC;
```

### 3. Automated Recovery
```typescript
listener.onEventType('device.offline', async (event) => {
  // Wait 10 minutes
  await sleep(600000);
  
  // Check if still offline
  const stillOffline = await checkDeviceStatus(event.aggregate_id);
  
  if (stillOffline) {
    // Trigger automated recovery (reboot, network reset, etc.)
    await triggerDeviceRecovery(event.aggregate_id);
  }
});
```

**Your device on/off events are now being captured!** ðŸŽ‰

When you turn a device off/on, here's what happens:
1. Device off â†’ Heartbeat monitor detects â†’ `device.offline` event (after 5 min)
2. Device on â†’ Sends state â†’ `device.online` + `device.heartbeat` events

Check with:
```sql
SELECT event_type, timestamp, data 
FROM events 
WHERE event_type IN ('device.online', 'device.offline') 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
